This repository contains all code &amp; images, as well as various other misceleneous files related to the website for Northern Development Inc. The website can be found here: [https://ndi.coolpage.biz](https://ndi.coolpage.biz), though the best example of what I can do with JavaScript is on the gallery page: [https://ndi.coolpage.biz/gallery.php](https://ndi.coolpage.biz/gallery.php). The performance of that page is the main testament to my ability to program efficiently as the host for this website is a free server with sparse resources. Though it is reliable enough to have existed since 2005 with nearly 100% uptime, it is slow.
