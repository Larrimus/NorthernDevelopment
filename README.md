# NorthernDevelopment
This repository contains all code &amp; images, as well as various other misceleneous files related to the website for Northern Development Inc. 

### [The Website](https://ndi.coolpage.biz)
The website can be found here: [https://ndi.coolpage.biz](https://ndi.coolpage.biz), though the best example of what I can do with JavaScript is on the gallery page: [https://ndi.coolpage.biz/gallery.php](https://ndi.coolpage.biz/gallery.php). The performance of that page is the main testament to my ability to program efficiently as the host for this website is a free server with sparse resources. Though it is reliable enough to have existed since 2005 with nearly 100% uptime, it is slow.

### [Source Code](Source Code)
Contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, &amp; image files related to the website. This folder is reserved largely for files that are actively used to create the website.
