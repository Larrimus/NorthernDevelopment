# Source Code
This repository contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, &amp; image files related to the website. This folder is reserved largely for files that are actively used to create the website.

### [Compressed Code](Compressed%20Code)
The [Compressed Code](Compressed%20Code) directory contains large files (such as attackhelicopter.js) with all their comments removed and often with their variables renamed to single characters in order to make them far smaller.

### [Bot-Trap](bot-trap)
The [bot-trap](bot-trap) directory contains three files associated with blocking bots that don't listen to the rules in robots.txt, and (one file)[bot-trap/Mobile_Detect.php] related to detecting if the browser the user has is a mobile one. Because that file is so large, this directory also has a compressed version of that file in its own [Compressed Code](bot-trap/Compressed%20Code) directory. This file is in this directory because it's included in one of the bot-trap files which is included in every page on the site.

### [Images](images)
The [images](images) directory contains image files used on the website.
